One ring to rule them all.

Today is a sunday in April and since there is nothing to visit in the Silicon Valley on the Lord’s day, I might as well go to church… But which one ? And which religion to praise, that is: which brand ?

I write on a macbook air made of a bright aluminium frame, so I have the answer. I will take communion in Apple’s cathedral, its headquarters the Ring, an immense circle built upon a spacecraft on the moon of Cupertino.

Deal ? ~~Don’t you think ?~~ Hmm… It **turns out** that aliens of ~~such a low social class~~ my humble origin can’t step foot in it; so I diverted to the chapel: the Apple Park Visitor Center and its famous and globally-known Apple Store. It could have been a pelerinage. Or to remain grounded, the quest aiming at least towards the symobolic epicenter of a revolutionary earthquake that has shaken our lives for 30 years.
